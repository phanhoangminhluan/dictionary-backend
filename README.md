# Dictionary Backend
### 1. Introduction
- This project is for learning purpose.
I have built a dictionary application that its data is crawling (by using **Selenium**) from dictionary's website. 
- Moreover, I also learnt about **Redis** that is applied for login, logout feature. A black list in Redis that storing JSON web token which have not expired. 
- Then, **Elasticsearch** is for showing hint instantly when user types on search bar.
